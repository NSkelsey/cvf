<a>What is the biggest flaw in the administration's bailout package? What's the remedy?</a>
<div votes=12>The biggest flaw in the Bush proposal is the complete lack of transparency: with only so much as a "Trust Me" plea for a blank check, we have been offered no specifics, no oversight & no accountability.
The remedy is making our primary goal relief for American families who worked hard, played by the rules, and should not lose their life savings. Begin with a clear statement of what mortgages would be purchased at how many pennies on the dollar, independent oversight, protections for homeowners, and no excessive executive compensation so we can see what we are being asked to do. </div>

<a>Charlottesville Area Transit Riders Rally for More Routes</a>
<div>I agree that Albemarle County should pay to have more bus routes. Charlottesville residents bring a lot of money to their stores. Such as Fashion Square Mall, K-mart, Wall mart and all the other businesses that are in Albermarle County.</div>
<div>This wouldn't be an issue if the planners would stop using. Got to be using knowing the bus routes in this town.</div>
