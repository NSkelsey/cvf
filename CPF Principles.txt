Charlottesville’s Public Forum was built from the belief that every
person has a right to express his or her opinion, and that the
avenue for that expression should be efficient, worthwhile, and
easy. CPF provides that avenue for expression. CPF gives citizens the
opportunity to express their views to others in their community, as
well as vote on the views of others. This allows Charlottesville
citizens to discuss and come to a consensus on an issue, or at least
clarify where the differences life. A democracy’s power comes from the
ability of the citizenry to communicate. In order to foster the most
constructive form of that communication we ask that you follow this set
of general principles:

* Civility is the best policy: If you don’t
have anything nice to say, that’s fine, but make sure you are
contributing in a constructive manner befitting of the democracy you
wish to take part of.
* Keep the discussion substantive.
* Each user is just as important as another.
By following these principles there are many possibilities for CPF.
When substantive, civil discussion is fostered, so too are good
ideas. When citizens stand behind great ideas those in power are
forced to listen. With this tool you can stand behind an idea with
just one click. Do not let this opportunity pass you by, use the
only thing that matters in a democracy, the voice of the citizenry.
Keep your government efficient, ensure it is working towards the
public good, and keep it honest; these are your duties as a member of this community, fulfill them here.
